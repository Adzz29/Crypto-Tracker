# Crypto Tracker

A Flask-based web application to track cryptocurrency portfolios and view live market prices using the CoinGecko API.

## Overview

Crypto Tracker is a personal project I built to showcase my full-stack development skills while studying Computer Science. It allows users to:
- **Track a crypto portfolio** – add, view, and delete coins with live price updates.
- **See market data** – top coins, 24-hour changes, market caps.
- **Interactive charts** – a 7-day Bitcoin price chart.
- **Search and filter** – find coins by name, symbol, or ID.

The goal of this project was to create a real, working tool rather than a static prototype, demonstrating back-end, front-end, and API integration skills.
